| **KEY_CACHE_SIZE_IN_MB**                     | A global cache setting for the maximum size of the key cache in memory (for all tables). .                                                                                                                                                |         |
| **KEY_CACHE_SAVE_PERIOD**                    | The duration in seconds that keys are saved in cache. Saved caches greatly improve cold-start speeds and has relatively little effect on I/O.                                                                                             | 14400   |
| **KEY_CACHE_KEYS_TO_SAVE**                   | The number of keys from the key cache to save.                                                                                                                                                                                            |         |
| **COUNTER_CACHE_SIZE_IN_MB**                 | Maximum size of the counter cache in memory. When no value is set, Cassandra uses the smaller of minimum of 2.5% of Heap or 50MB.                                                                                                         |         |

| **ROW_CACHE_SIZE_IN_MB**                     | Maximum size of the row cache in memory. Row cache can save more time than key_cache_size_in_mb, but is space-intensive because it contains the entire row. Use the row cache only for hot rows or static rows. 0 disables the row cache. | 0       |
| **ROW_CACHE_SAVE_PERIOD**                    | Duration in seconds that rows are saved in cache. 0 disables saving .                                                                                                                                                                     | 0       |

| **FILE_CACHE_SIZE_IN_MB**                    | The total memory to use for SSTable-reading buffers. Defaults to the smaller of 1/4 of heap or 512MB.                                                                                                                                     |         |
| **ROW_CACHE_CLASS_NAME**                     | Row cache implementation class name. Can be 'org.apache.cassandra.cache.OHCProvider' (default) or 'org.apache.cassandra.cache.SerializingCacheProvider'.                                                                                  |         |
| **BUFFER_POOL_USE_HEAP_IF_EXHAUSTED**        | Allocate on-heap memory when the SSTable buffer pool is exhausted.                                                                                                                                                                        |         |

|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **NODE_TOPOLOGY**           | This describes a multi-datacenter setup. When set it has precedence over NODE_COUNT. See docs/multidatacenter.md for more details.                                                                                                                                  |         |
| **SERVICE_ACCOUNT_INSTALL** | If true, the operator automatically installs a cluster role, service account and role binding. This is required for advanced functionality of multi-datacenter setups.                                                                                              | False   |
| **NODE_ANTI_AFFINITY**      | Ensure that every Cassandra node is deployed on a separate Kubernetes node. (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity)                                                                         | False   |
| **EXTERNAL_SEED_NODES**     | List of seed nodes external to this instance to add to the cluster. This allows clusters spanning multiple Kubernetes clusters.                                                                                                                                     |         |
| **INTER_DC_TCP_NODELAY**    | Enable or disable tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication. Disabling it will result in larger (but fewer) network packets being sent, reducing overhead from the TCP protocol itself, at the cost of increasing latency if you block for cross-datacenter responses. |         |

| **COMMITLOG_SYNC_BATCH_WINDOW_IN_MS**        | Time to wait between batch fsyncs, if commitlog_sync is in batch mode then default value should be: 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |              |
| **COMMITLOG_SEGMENT_SIZE_IN_MB**             | The size of each commit log segment in Mb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 32           |
| **CONCURRENT_READS**                         | For workloads with more data than can fit in memory, the bottleneck is reads fetching data from disk. Setting to (16 times the number of drives) allows operations to queue low enough in the stack so that the OS and drives can reorder them.                                                                                                                                                                           | 16           |
| **CONCURRENT_WRITES**                        | Writes in Cassandra are rarely I/O bound, so the ideal number of concurrent writes depends on the number of CPU cores in your system. The recommended value is 8 times the number of cpu cores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 32           |
| **CONCURRENT_COUNTER_WRITES**                | Counter writes read the current values before incrementing and writing them back. The recommended value is (16 times the number of drives) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 16           |

| **MEMTABLE_ALLOCATION_TYPE**                 | The type of allocations for the Cassandra memtable. heap_buffers keep all data on the JVM heap. offheap_buffers may reduce heap utilization for large string or binary values. offheap_objects may improve heap size for small integers or UUIDs as well. Both off heap options will increase read latency. (https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/configuration/cassandra_config_file.html#memtable-allocation-type ). | heap_buffers |
| **INDEX_SUMMARY_RESIZE_INTERVAL_IN_MINUTES** | How frequently index summaries should be re-sampled in minutes. This is done periodically to redistribute memory from the fixed-size pool to SSTables proportional their recent read rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 60           |
| **TRICKLE_FSYNC**                            | When set to true, causes fsync to force the operating system to flush the dirty buffers at the set interval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | false        |

| **COMPACTION_THROUGHPUT_MB_PER_SEC**         | Throttles compaction to the specified total throughput across the node. Compaction frequency varies with direct proportion to write throughput and is necessary to limit the SSTable size. The recommended value is 16 to 32 times the rate of write throughput (in MB/second).                                                                                                                                           | 64           |
| **SSTABLE_PREEMPTIVE_OPEN_INTERVAL_IN_MB**   | When compacting, the replacement opens SSTables before they are completely written and uses in place of the prior SSTables for any range previously written. This setting helps to smoothly transfer reads between the SSTables by reducing page cache churn and keeps hot rows hot.                                                                                                                                      | 50           |
